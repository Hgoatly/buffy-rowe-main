            Perhaps you have tried many approaches with only short term or
            limited success. You may even doubt that you can ever feel how you

            I’m Buffy Rowe, a Registered Nutritional Therapist and Health Coach.
            I specialise in helping my clients achieve the quality of life they
            have been craving.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-5">
            I combine Nutritional Therapy with Health coaching and specialist
            training in disorder eating behaviours and obesity. In overcoming
            anxieties a out food and health issues, my clients find freedom from
            their uncomfortable symptoms, to be able to live the balanced, calm
            and liberated lives they have been longing for, often for many
            years.

          <p class="mx-5">
            I have had personal experience of living with thyroid hormone
            issues, distressing anxiety related IBS symptoms and have worked
            through unwanted disordered eating behaviours. It has been quite a
            journey and one that I feel proud and grateful for. It lead my to my
            extensive retraining and the creation of a career that I love. I am
            passionate my clients feeling heard, supported and empowered as they
            turn their health around.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-5">
            With a thyroid condition that was diagnosed at a young age (teens),
            my personal health journey started at a young age. My symptoms
            started to shape my self confidence, self esteem and enjoyment of
            life. Fast forward to around 2014 and I decided to try a new
            approach, firstly for myself, and then my career. I haven’t looked
            back!
          </p>
          <p class="mx-5">
            I was a professional freelance musician (violinist) for 14 years and
            am no stranger to the never ending challenges of balancing work and
            family and matching lifestyle with health issues. Musicians have
            unconventional and colourful lifestyles. Working hours are erratic
            and coupled with a heady mix of adrenaline, excitement, and often
            high anxiety. Once I had started a family, they came first, and my
            own health and well being trailed behind. I had no idea that it was
            possible to strike a fulfilling and healthy balance....
