            <h2>PART 1</h2>
            <h3>The Nutritional Therapy Descriptor </h3>
            <p>Nutritional therapy is the application of nutrition and lifestyle medicine services in the promotion of health, peak performance and individual care.  Registered Nutritional Therapy Practitioners assess and identify potential nutritional imbalances and understand how these may contribute to an individual’s symptoms and health concerns.  This approach allows them to work with indiviuals to address nutritional imbalance and help support the body towards maintaining health.</p>
            <p>Nutritional Therapy is recognised as a complementary medicine and is relevant for individuals with chronic conditions, as well as those looking for support to enhance their health and wellbeing.  Practitioners never recommend nutritional therapy as a replacement for medical advice and always refer any client with ‘red flag’ signs or symptoms to their medical professional.  They frequently work alongside medical professionals and will communicate with other healthcare professionals involved in the client’s care to explain any nutritional therapy programme that has been provided. </p>
            <p>The Registered Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (RNTP) requests that the client notes the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The degree of benefit obtainable from NT may vary between clients with similar health problems and following a similar nutritional therapy programme</li>
                <li>Nutrition and Lifestyle recommendations will be tailored to support health conditions and/or health concerns identified and agreed between both parties. </li>
                <li>As a RNTP, I am not permitted to diagnose, or claim to treat, medical conditions</li>
                <li>As a RNTP, my recommendations are not a substitute for professional medical advise an/or treatment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A signed copy must be retained by both the client and the RNTP</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I may recommend food supplements an/or functional testing as part of your NT programme and may receive a commission on these products</li>
                <li>Standards of professional practice in NT are governed byt the CNHC (Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council code of conduct, ethics and performance</li>
                <li>This document only covers the practice of nutritional therapy within this consultation, and I will make it clear if I intend to provide services that are outside the scope of nutritional therapy practice</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The client understands and agrees to the following: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I, the client, am responsible for contacting my GP about any health concerns</li>
                <li>If I am receiving treatment from my GP, or any other medical provider, I should tell him/her about any nutritional recommendations provided by me, as your RNTP.  This is necessary because of any possible reaction between medication and the nutritional programme</li>
                <li>It is important that I tell my RNTP about any medical diagnosis, medication, herbal medicine or food supplements I am taking as this may affect the nutritional programme</li>
                <li>If I am unclear about the agreed nutritional therapy programme/food supplement doses/time period, I should contact my RNTP promptly for clarification</li>
                <li>I understand that the recommendations are personal to me an and may not be appropriate for others</li>
                <li>I must contact my RNTP should I wish to continue any specified supplement programme for longer than the originally agreed period, to avoid any potential adverse reactions</li>
                <li>Recording consultaions using any form of electronic media is not allowed without the written permission of both me and my RNTP</li>
                <li>It is my responsibility to ensure I have a working internet connection for online appointments.  If I am unable to connect as scheduled, the appointment is considered a ‘no show’ and charged in full</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Confidentiality and Data Protection</p>
            <p>I, your RNTP will keep your personal information confiential and secure following the UK GDPR guidelines for the practice.  I will not share your information with third parties without your consent.  However ,if I believe there is a risk of signifiant harm to yourself or another person, I may pass the information onto an appropriate authority using the leal basis of vital interest.  A separate Privacy and Consent Notice is available for your review</p>
            <h2>Part 2</h2>
            <h3>Payment Terms and Cancellation Policy: </h3>
            <p>Fees are agreed in advance of the appointment and are paid in advance of a first appointment and/or an online appointment.  No NT plan or recommendations will be issued without full payment.   
              Payment can be made by bank transfer. 
              Appointments cancelled with less that 48 hours notice and ‘no shows’ will be charged in full except under extreme circumstances. 
            </p>
            <p>In the case of advance payments for service, you have the right to cancel this Agreement within 14 days of the purchase without penalty (‘cooling off period’.  If you wish to terminate the agreement within the 14 days Cooling-Off Period you must do so in writing to <a href="mailto:buffy@buffyrowe.com">buffy@buffyrowe.com</a>. I will refund any monies paid prior to cancelling this agreement.  If the services have commenced during the 14 day Cooling-Off Period, I will refund any monies due to you for services yet provided. The refund payent will be made within 14 days of cancellation. </p>
            <p>We understand the above and agree that my professional serices will be based on the content of this Agreement.  I declare that all the information we share during this professional relationship is confidential and to the best of my knowledge is true and correct. </p>

Consents will be granular to provide choice as to which data will be collected and for what purpose.  I will seek explicit consent wherever possible.
                I will maintain an audit trail of consent by documenting details of consent received including who consented, when, how, what if and when they withdraw consent. 
                I will regularly review consents and seek to refresh them regularly or if anything changes. 
                </p>

                I can refuse to respond to certain requests and can, in circumstances of the request being manifestly unfounded or excessive, charge a fee.  If the request is for a large quantity of data, I can request the individual specify the information they are requesting. 
                Once a subject access request has been made, I will not change or amend any of the data that has been requested.  Doing so is a criminal offence. 
                </p>
            <h3>Data Portability Requests: </h3>
            <p>I will provide the data requested in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format.  This would normally be a PDF file, although other formats are acceptable.  We must provide this data either to the individual who has requested it, or to the data controller they have requested it be sent to within one month. 
                I will not transfer personal data abroad without express consent. 
                </p>
            <h3>Third Parties: </h3>

                </p>
            <h3>Breaches:</h3>
